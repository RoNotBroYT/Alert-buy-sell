# Alert-buy-sell
<P1>It helps traders know what is happening in every stock with custom alerts that inform you in an instant. Self developed.</P1>

<H1>What it does</H1>
<P1>Its funtion is to anyaise charts and send alerts to tell the trader what is happing in every stock.
Also once Version 1 is finshed, It will be able to buy and sell stocks off custom and preset alerts. 
This will take longer as I need to test it on paper trading to make sure it is not buggy.
Version 1 should Be finshed by July 12, if finished earler/later this will be upadted.</P1>
